Python is our passion, spreading its word is our mission. We are Python Italia,
a non-profit organisation born in Florence in April 2007 from the dream of a
few Italian fans of the most beautiful programming language ever created.
Since then, weâ€™ve grown into a big community with more than XXX members,
we partnered with our brethren communities to exchange ideas,
organize events, learn together, grow together and have loads
of PyFun! Want to join us? Send an email to [info@python.it](info@python.it)
